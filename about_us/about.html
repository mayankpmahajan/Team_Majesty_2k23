	At medGPT, our goal is to make it easier for people to take control of their health and make informed decisions about their medical care.
    We know that navigating the healthcare system can be overwhelming, and that many people struggle to get timely and accurate diagnoses for their symptoms.
	That's why we've created a powerful symptom prediction tool that uses advanced algorithms and cutting-edge technology to help people get the information they
	need to make informed decisions about their health.Our tool is designed to be easy to use and understand, even for people who have no medical background.
	Simply enter your symptoms into the tool, and our algorithms will analyze your data to provide you with a list of possible diagnoses. Unlike many other symptom checkers on the market,
	our tool is constantly evolving and improving, thanks to our team's dedication to research andÂ development.
